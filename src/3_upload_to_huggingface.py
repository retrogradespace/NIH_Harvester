"""
NIH_Harvester, stage 3 uploads the current local dataset to Hugging Face
Hub as a private dataset repo (retrogradespace/nih-reporter-harvest) that is later made public.

Rerunnable and incremental by design: this project is being uploaded in
waves as 1_harvest_raw.py completes more fiscal years, not all at once at
the end. Hugging Face's upload is content-addressed (via git/LFS under the
hood) rerunning this after more years finish only transfers what
changed, not the whole dataset again.

Uploads two things:
    data/nih_harvester.db          -> repo root, as nih_harvester.db
    data/raw/fy*.jsonl (+ manifests) -> repo's raw/ folder
(.done marker files are local bookkeeping only, not uploaded.)

Repo starts PRIVATE flip to public on huggingface.co once you've
reviewed the uploaded content, rather than this script deciding that.

Credentials: reads HF_TOKEN from ~/.config/nih_harvester/hf.env -- kept
outside version control entirely rather than as a gitignored in-repo file,
so there's no risk of it ever ending up in a commit.

# NIH RePORTER Harvest

A complete, nationwide pull of NIH RePORTER project records, fiscal years
1985-present, with no institution scoping applied. Roughly 2.96 million
records across 42 fiscal years, harvested to nationwide completeness (see
Coverage below) rather than filtered to any subset of institutions,
agencies, or award types.

See the harvesting code and full writeup at
https://github.com/retrogradespace/NIH_Harvester schema-on-read design,
the adaptive pagination strategy that gets full coverage despite NIH's
10,000-record pagination cap at nationwide volumes, and the two derived
analytical views described below.

## Files

- `nih_harvester.db` a SQLite database (~22 GB). Table `nih_raw_projects`
  holds one row per record with the full raw API response verbatim in
  `raw_json` (schema-on-read: nothing is dropped, typed, or restricted at
  load time). Two derived views are included:
  - `nih_parsed` flattens `raw_json` into ~50 individual columns
    (organization, dates, funding amounts, PI/investigator info, etc.) via
    SQLite's `json_extract()`.
  - `nih_indicators` layers a worked analytical example on `nih_parsed`:
    multi-year-funding (MYF) classification, budget/project duration in
    days, and a fiscal-year field keyed off `award_notice_date`.
- `raw/fy<year>.jsonl` (~20 GB total) the original per-fiscal-year raw
  pulls this database was built from, one JSON record per line exactly as
  returned by the API, before any loading or transformation. Each year has
  a matching `fy<year>.manifest.json` recording when it was harvested and
  how many records it produced.

## Schema (`nih_raw_projects`)

```
appl_id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY   -- NIH's unique id per fiscal-year application record
project_num        TEXT
core_project_num   TEXT
fiscal_year        INTEGER
raw_json           TEXT NOT NULL         -- the full API record, verbatim
row_hash           TEXT NOT NULL         -- sha256 of raw_json's canonical form
valid_from         TEXT
valid_to           TEXT                  -- unused for now; reserved for future history tracking
is_current         INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
```

## Coverage and known limitations

- Harvested to nationwide completeness via dual-pass pagination (asc+desc)
  for buckets under NIH's 20,000-record ceiling, escalating to a
  discovered-agency split (verified against a fallback list of current and
  historical/defunct agency codes) for any bucket over that. Every split
  level's fetched count is checked against that level's own unfiltered
  total from the API, and any shortfall is logged rather than silently
  dropped see each year's `manifest.json` / the GitHub repo's
  `logs/harvest_*.log` convention for those warnings.
- A small number of records (measured around 0.1-0.6% in the years
  checked) may still be missing records with no agency code on file, or
  belonging to an agency/state combination not covered by discovery.
  Nothing is silently interpolated or estimated; a missing record is
  simply absent.
- FY2026 (and possibly the tail of the most recent closed fiscal year) is
  a snapshot as of harvest time, not a closed-out year the federal fiscal
  year runs Oct 1-Sep 30, so the current year's totals will keep growing
  in NIH's own system after this snapshot was taken. Check the relevant
  `fy<year>.manifest.json`'s `finished_at` for exactly when each year was
  pulled.
- **Worth knowing about the MYF classification specifically:** it's
  narrower than "does this project span multiple years." It requires the
  *budget* period to exactly match the *project* period, which most
  individual fiscal-year records don't, since standard NIH practice is to
  fund one year at a time via annual non-competing continuations. "Multi-
  year Funding" in NIH's own usage means the rarer case where a project's
  entire multi-year budget was obligated in one lump sum up front.
