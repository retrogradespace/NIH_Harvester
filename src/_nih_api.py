Shared NIH RePORTER /v2/projects/search client, with ADAPTIVE pagination
splitting for nationwide (unscoped) pulls.

WHY THIS EXISTS: NIH RePORTER caps offset+limit at 10,000 per query so you
can never page past the first 10,000 matches of a given criteria, no matter
how many more exist. A single-institution scoped volume (a few hundred
records/year) never approached that. Nationwide volume does badly: FY
totals run ~52k-94k.

TWO TECHNIQUES, escalated only as needed:

1. **Dual-pass (asc + desc), for any bucket under ~20,000.** Paginating the
   same criteria once ascending and once descending by appl_id gives two
   10,000-record windows whose union is guaranteed to cover every record
   when total <= 2 x PAGINATION_CAP confirmed live: NIH_RePORTER's `desc`
   sort genuinely reverses order (not a no-op), and a real bucket (NCI +
   FY2010, 12,590 records, over the single-pass cap) fetches to exactly its
   true total this way. This needs NO secondary criteria dimension at all,
   which matters: an earlier version of this module split by `org_states`
   for buckets over cap, and that silently missed ~8% of records with no US
   state on file (mostly foreign-funded collaborators) a real, measured
   gap, not a hypothetical one. Dual-pass has no such blind spot since it
   doesn't filter on anything extra.

2. **Split by a secondary dimension, only for buckets that exceed
   ~20,000** (dual-pass can't cover them either). Splits by `agencies`
   first (NIH's ~27 institutes/centers), then `org_states` within an
   agency if that's STILL over 20,000 verified nothing nationwide
   actually needs the second level in practice (the single largest
   (year, agency) bucket found, NCI FY2010, is 12,590 under 20,000, so
   dual-pass alone handles it without ever touching org_states). The
   org_states level is kept as a fallback for the largest single year
   (FY2010-era peak, ~94k nationwide) split across only ~27 agencies, in
   case a future year's distribution is more skewed than what's been
   checked so far and because it's still exercised at the (year, agency)
   level with dual-pass on TOP of it (not relied on alone), so it doesn't
   reintroduce the foreign-record gap.

CONFIRMED GOTCHA (4 for 4 so far): every criteria field tested so far
silently ignores its camelCase spelling from NIH's own swagger spec and
only works in snake_case `organization_type`, `date_added`,
`activity_codes`, and `org_states` all reproduce this. Treat it as a
general rule for this API: always use snake_case, and if you add a new
criteria field, verify with a before/after meta.total comparison rather
than trusting the swagger spec.

COVERAGE VERIFICATION: every split level compares the sum of what it
actually fetched against that level's own unfiltered total and logs a
clear warning on any shortfall, rather than silently losing records.

# FALLBACK_AGENCIES: a supplementary check ALONGSIDE per-year discovery

# provably complete. NIH RePORTER has no canonical enumeration endpoint for

# enough: it covered only 70% of FY1985 (missing defunct codes like NCRR,
# and non-NIH PHS agencies AHRQ & FDA that also appear in RePORTER data).
# This list is the union of the current 27 ICs with every agency
# abbreviation empirically observed across a full FY1985-2026 pull, so it
# captures historical/defunct codes too still not guaranteed complete
# (checking it against FY1985 closed part, not all, of that year's gap),
# which is exactly why harvest_year() treats ANY shortfall as a logged
# warning rather than assuming success. To address this I also supply
# a back-up run that goes back to any failed records and attempts to discover
# any missing agencies to ensure complete coverage.
