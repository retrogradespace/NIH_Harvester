"""
NIH_Harvester, stage 2 loads every data/raw/fy*.jsonl file produced by
1_harvest_raw.py into data/nih_harvester.db, a single SQLite landing table
(nih_raw_projects) covering all fiscal years, all institutions.

Idempotent and resumable: hashes the current DB contents once up front
(existing_hashes), then only inserts new / updates changed / skips
unchanged records as it streams through the JSONL files rerunning after
an interruption (or after 1_harvest_raw.py adds more years later) doesn't
redo work already done. Same principle as a typical incremental warehouse
loader, see _sqlite_landing.py.

Streams line-by-line in batches (BATCH_SIZE), not one giant read since the
full harvest will eventually be millions of records across possibly tens
of GB of JSONL, too large to hold in memory at once.

Usage:
