STILL UNDER DEV -- NIH_Harvester, stage 1b second-pass gap backfill for fiscal years where
1_harvest_raw.py's own coverage check logged a shortfall (see
logs/harvest_*.log: "WARNING: FY<year> covered X/Y of N record(s) still
missing").

WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT: 1_harvest_raw.py / _nih_api.py are intentionally left
untouched. The shortfall isn't a bug in that logic for any year over the
20,000 dual-pass ceiling, it splits by `agencies` (a year-specific discovery
sample unioned with a static fallback list), and the residual gap is
precisely the records that split can never reach: agency_ic_admin is null,
or a code that never showed up in that year's discovery sample or the
fallback list. Re-running the exact same agency-split logic finds the exact
same shortfall every time, since discovery is deterministic it needs a
genuinely different split dimension, not a retry.

SPLIT DIMENSION activity_code, not date. A date-based split (from_date/
to_date on award_notice_date / project_start_date) was tried first and
empirically failed for older years: probing FY1985 directly showed
award_notice_date populated on only 11 of 49,745 records, and
project_start_date on ~34,000 NIH's own admin metadata is sparse before
roughly 2011, and an explicit from/to range excludes null-valued records
entirely (only a wide-open, filter-free query matches nulls), so no amount
of bucket-widening can recover them.

activity_code (e.g. "R01", "T32") doesn't have this problem: it's part of
every award's project_num format (5T32ES007043-08 -> activity_code T32) and
was confirmed 0-null across all 49,745 FY1985 records already on file
structurally present the way agency_ic_admin structurally is NOT. Discovery
here uses every fy<year>.jsonl record already on file as the sample (not a
20k initial dual-pass) since that file already holds the large majority
of the year's records, its own activity_code distribution is a strictly
better source than resampling, and a single get_total() with the full
discovered-codes list as an OR-filter is used as a coverage self-check
(matches nationwide total exactly for FY1985) before spending any fetch
calls. Same escalate-only-as-needed shape as _nih_api.harvest_year: each
code buckets under the dual-pass ceiling gets one dual-pass; a code bucket
that somehow doesn't (not observed, but a future year's mechanism mix could
skew this) escalates to an org_state split under it, exactly mirroring
_nih_api.py's own agency -> org_state escalation.

APPEND-ONLY: new records are appended (not rewritten) to the existing
fy<year>.jsonl, and seen_appl_ids/discovered codes are both seeded from
that file's current contents, so fetch_bucket's own dedup guarantees
nothing already there is touched or duplicated. Stage 1's
fy<year>.manifest.json and fy<year>.done are left exactly as stage 1 wrote
them; this script writes its own fy<year>.gapfill_manifest.json and logs to
a separate logs/gapfill_*.log. 2_load_to_sqlite.py needs no changes either
it's already idempotent and keyed on appl_id, so rerunning it after this
picks up exactly the new rows.

Usage:
    ../.venv/bin/python3 1b_backfill_gaps.py                # all done years, auto-skips clean ones
    ../.venv/bin/python3 1b_backfill_gaps.py start 1985 end 1985   # a single year, for testing
